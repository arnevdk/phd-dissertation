\section{Introduction}

Communication BCIs have a target population consisting of patients in various
stages of paralysis or Locked-in Syndrome, often suffering from oculomotor im-
pairments. This reduces their performance operating visual event-related poten-
tial (ERP) BCIs, since they are unable to comfortably redirect their gaze at the de-
sired target, i.e., overt visuospatial attention (VSA). Instead, they are forced to op-
erate in covert VSA, where the gaze and VSA do not coincide. Several studies show
that performance drops in covert VSA [2, 1], necessitating gaze-independent so-
lutions. Our previous study [3] indicates gaze-independent performance can be
improved in healthy subjects using a suited decoding strategy. Currently, we aim
to verify this in patients.
