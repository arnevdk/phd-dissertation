  abstract = {It is generally believed that eye movements are completely spared in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). Although a series of eye movement abnormalities has been recognized in recent years, the findings are highly controversial, and bulbar disabilities should be considered in relation to eye movement abnormalities. The present study aimed to determine whether eye movement abnormalities are present in ALS and, if so, to investigate their characteristics and their association with bulbar disability in ALS patients. A total of 60 patients and 30 controls were recruited and underwent the standardized evaluations of the oculomotor system using videonystagmography. Square-wave jerks (OR: 16.20, 95\% CI: 3.50–74.95, p {\textless} 0.001) and abnormal cogwheeling during smooth pursuit (OR: 14.04, 95\% CI: 3.00–65.75, p = 0.001) were more frequently observed in ALS patients than in the control subjects. In subgroup analyses, square-wave jerks (OR: 26.51, 95\% CI: 2.83–248.05, p = 0.004) and abnormal cogwheeling during smooth pursuit (OR: 6.56, 95\% CI: 1.19–36.16, p = 0.031) were found to be more common in ALS patients with bulbar involvement (n = 44) than in those without bulbar involvement (n = 16). There were no significant differences in the investigated eye movement parameters between bulbar-onset (n = 12) and spinal-onset patients (n = 48). ALS patients showed a range of eye movement abnormalities, affecting mainly the ocular fixation and smooth pursuit systems. Our pioneering study indicates that the region of involvement could better indicate the pathophysiological essence of the abnormalities than the type of onset pattern in ALS. Eye movement abnormalities may be potential clinical markers for objectively evaluating upper brainstem or supratentorial cerebral lesion neurodegeneration in ALS.},

  abstract   = {Multiple sclerosis (MS) commonly causes eye movement abnormalities that may have a significant impact on patients’ disability. Inflammatory demyelinating lesions, especially occurring in the posterior fossa, result in a wide range of disorders, spanning from acquired pendular nystagmus (APN) to internuclear ophthalmoplegia (INO), among the most common. As the control of eye movements is well understood in terms of anatomical substrate and underlying physiological network, studying ocular motor abnormalities in MS provides a unique opportunity to gain insights into mechanisms of disease. Quantitative measurement and modeling of eye movement disorders, such as INO, may lead to a better understanding of common symptoms encountered in MS, such as Uhthoff’s phenomenon and fatigue. In turn, the pathophysiology of a range of eye movement abnormalities, such as APN, has been clarified based on correlation of experimental model with lesion localization by neuroimaging in MS. Eye movement disorders have the potential of being utilized as structural and functional biomarkers of early cognitive deficit, and possibly help in assessing disease status and progression, and to serve as platform and functional outcome to test novel therapeutic agents for MS. Knowledge of neuropharmacology applied to eye movement dysfunction has guided testing and use of a number of pharmacological agents to treat some eye movement disorders found in MS, such as APN and other forms of central nystagmus.},

  abstract = {Video-oculography (VOG) could be useful for monitoring neurodegenerative diseases and multiple sclerosis (MS), as a high prevalence of subclinical eye movements abnormalities (EMA) has been previously reported, with a potential prognostic value regarding disease evolution. However, access to VOG is limited in clinical practice.
To evaluate the reliability of VOG recordings performed using eVOG, a mobile application developed on an iPad.
Patients with MS or related disease without clinically detectable EMA were enrolled in a cross-sectional study during which two VOG exams (classical VOG and eVOG) were performed on the same day. We examined reflex saccades, antisaccades, smooth pursuit and fixation. The total number of deficits, saccadic latencies and velocities, qualitative smooth pursuit were compared.
30 patients were included. The mean number of EMA per patient on classical VOG was 4.1 and 2.3 on eVOG. We found a statistical association between the number of EMA for each exam (r = 0.66, p {\textless} 0.0001). Saccades latencies (r = 0.57, p {\textless} 0.0001) and velocities (r = 0.45, p {\textless} 0.0001) were also well correlated. Assessing eVOG accuracy, we found a sensitivity ranging from 44\% to 100\% and a specificity ranging from 71\% to 88.9\% depending on the considered abnormality.
eVOG could be an easily accessible solution to screen MS patients for the presence of EMA. We plan to use eVOG on a larger cohort of patients, in a prospective study to assess the prognostic value of subclinical EMA in MS. We also plan to investigate the use of eVOG in other neurological conditions
Eye movement abnormalities (EMA) are common in multiple sclerosis (MS). However, type and severity according to the MS stage are poorly known, especially in Radiologically Isolated Syndrome (RIS) and in Clinically Isolated Syndrome (CIS). Although MRI has been included in the MS diagnostic criteria, there may be clinical-radiological dissociation.
To analyze by video-oculography (VOG) prevalence of EMA in different MS phenotypes and study correlations with brain and cervical cord MRI T2 lesions location.
76 participants were prospectively recruited (12 RIS, 10 CIS, 11 relapsing-remitting-MS, 10 secondary progressive-MS, 10 primary progressive MS and 23 gender and age-matched healthy controls). We analyzed fixations, anti-saccades, horizontal and vertical reflex saccades and smooth pursuit.
EMA were frequent and of gradual severity from RIS to progressive forms. Internuclear ophthalmoplegia (INO) and centripetal hypermetria were strong arguments for the diagnosis of a demyelinating disorder versus a control population. Some EMA were linked to infratentorial T2 lesion location, but others like INO were not.
This study confirm that EMA are common in all MS phenotypes, even at the earliest stages. VOG can be useful to detect demyelinating process at preclinical stage by highlighting subclinical EMA even in absence of characteristic lesions visible on MRI.
Primary progressive aphasia (PPA) is a neurological syndrome, associated with both frontotemporal dementia and Alzheimer's disease, in which progressive language impairment emerges as the most salient clinical feature during the initial stages of disease.
We screened the main genes associated with Alzheimer's disease and frontotemporal dementia for pathogenic and risk variants in a cohort of 403 PPA cases.
In this case series study, 14 (3.5\%) cases carried (likely) pathogenic variants: four C9orf72 expansions, nine GRN, and one TARDBP mutation. Rare risk variants, TREM2 R47H and MAPT A152T, were associated with a three- to seven-fold increase in risk for PPA.
Our results show that while pathogenic variants within the most common dementia genes were rarely associated with PPA, these were found almost exclusively in GRN and C9orf72, suggesting that PPA is more TDP43- than tau-related in our series. This is consistent with the finding that PPA frequency in dominantly inherited dementias is the highest in kindreds with GRN variants.
Radiation-induced hypoglossal nerve palsy is a debilitating and irreversible late complication after definitive radiotherapy for nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) and other skull base tumors. This study sets to evaluate its incidence and clinical predictive factors, and to propose relevant dosimetric constraints for this structure to guide radiotherapy planning.
We undertook a retrospective review of 797 NPC patients who underwent definitive intensity-modulated radiotherapy (IMRT) between 2003 and 2011. Cumulative incidence and clinical predictors for radiation-induced hypoglossal nerve palsy were evaluated. Archived radiotherapy plans were retrieved and 330 independent hypoglossal nerves were retrospectively contoured following standardized atlas. Optimal threshold analyses of dosimetric parameters (Dmax, D0.5cc, D1cc, D2cc, Dmean) were conducted using receiver operating characteristic curves. Normal tissue complication probability was generated with logistic regression modeling.
With a median follow-up of 8.1 years, sixty-nine (8.7\%) patients developed radiation-induced hypoglossal nerve palsy. High radiotherapy dose, premorbid diabetes, advanced T-stage and radiological hypoglossal canal involvement were independent clinical risk factors. Maximum dose received by 1 cc volume (D1cc) was the best predictor for the development of radiation-induced nerve palsy (AUC = 0.826) at 8 years after IMRT. Hypoglossal nerves with D1cc of 74 Gy EQD2 had an estimated palsy risk of 4.7\%. Nerves with D1cc {\textless}74 Gy EQD2 had significantly lower risk of palsy than those ≥74 Gy EQD2 (2.4\% vs 20.8\%, p {\textless}0.001).
Incidence of radiation-induced hypoglossal nerve palsy was high after definitive IMRT for NPC. D1cc {\textless}74 Gy EQD2 can serve as a useful dose constraint to adopt during radiotherapy planning to limit palsy risk to {\textless}5\% at 8 years after IMRT.
Although the Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS) is the “gold-standard” tool in assessing the severity of symptoms in patients with Parkinson's disease (PD), not all activity-related disease symptoms can be accurately captured by the well-established clinical rating scale. Using an alternative approach, this study examined the level of physical activity measured by actigraphy over time and whether change in physical activity was associated with disease severity assessed by UPDRS.
We used a longitudinal design in which physical activity and disease severity were assessed repeatedly during a 4-month interval, over a 3-year observational period, in a sample of 61 patients with idiopathic PD and a control group of 32 neurologically intact individuals. Physical activity data during awake-time were analyzed using the power-law exponent (PLE) method. Correlational relationships between changes in maxima values of PLE and scores of total UPDRS, UPDRS—part II (Activities of Daily Living), and UPDRS—part III (Motor Examination) in patients with PD were examined. Results show an increase in maxima values of PLE and the UPDRS total score in PD patients and that there is a positive association between changes in maxima values and total UPDRS score (r = 0.746, p = 0.032), UPDRS—part II score (r = 0.687, p = 0.027), and UPDRS—part III score (r = 0.893, p = 0.018). There was no significant change in the level of physical activity over time for the controls.
Findings from this study indicate that change in physical activity, as captured by actigraphy, is associated with increased severity in patients' clinical symptoms of PD over time. Thus, these data suggest that, when used in conjunction with the conventional UPDRS measure, an actigraphic measure of physical activity may provide clinicians an adjunct measurement approach to monitor patients' activity-based disease progression or responses to treatment in outpatient clinic settings.
Acquired pendular nystagmus is comprised of quasi-sinusoidal oscillations of the eyes significantly affecting gaze holding and clarity of vision. The most common causes of acquired pendular nystagmus include demyelinating disorders such as multiple sclerosis and the syndrome of ocular palatal tremor. However, several other deficits, such as pharmacological intoxication, metabolic and genetic disorders, and granulomatous disorders can lead to syndromes mimicking acquired pendular nystagmus. Study of the kinematic features of acquired pendular nystagmus has suggested a putative pathophysiology of an otherwise mysterious neurological disorder. Here we review clinical features of neurological deficits that co-occur with acquired pendular nystagmus. Subsequent discussion of the pathophysiology of individual forms of pendular nystagmus speculates on mechanisms of the underlying disease while providing insights into pharmacotherapy of nystagmus.
This article reports a patient with acquired hepatocerebral degeneration that presented with progressive cerebellar ataxia, cerebellar atrophy, and middle cerebellar peduncle lesions. He had a marked improvement after liver transplantation. We reinforce that hepatic failure should be investigated in patients with pure cerebellar syndrome, resembling neurodegenerative diseases.},
