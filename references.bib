  abstract = {It is generally believed that eye movements are completely spared in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). Although a series of eye movement abnormalities has been recognized in recent years, the findings are highly controversial, and bulbar disabilities should be considered in relation to eye movement abnormalities. The present study aimed to determine whether eye movement abnormalities are present in ALS and, if so, to investigate their characteristics and their association with bulbar disability in ALS patients. A total of 60 patients and 30 controls were recruited and underwent the standardized evaluations of the oculomotor system using videonystagmography. Square-wave jerks (OR: 16.20, 95\% CI: 3.50–74.95, p {\textless} 0.001) and abnormal cogwheeling during smooth pursuit (OR: 14.04, 95\% CI: 3.00–65.75, p = 0.001) were more frequently observed in ALS patients than in the control subjects. In subgroup analyses, square-wave jerks (OR: 26.51, 95\% CI: 2.83–248.05, p = 0.004) and abnormal cogwheeling during smooth pursuit (OR: 6.56, 95\% CI: 1.19–36.16, p = 0.031) were found to be more common in ALS patients with bulbar involvement (n = 44) than in those without bulbar involvement (n = 16). There were no significant differences in the investigated eye movement parameters between bulbar-onset (n = 12) and spinal-onset patients (n = 48). ALS patients showed a range of eye movement abnormalities, affecting mainly the ocular fixation and smooth pursuit systems. Our pioneering study indicates that the region of involvement could better indicate the pathophysiological essence of the abnormalities than the type of onset pattern in ALS. Eye movement abnormalities may be potential clinical markers for objectively evaluating upper brainstem or supratentorial cerebral lesion neurodegeneration in ALS.},

  abstract   = {Multiple sclerosis (MS) commonly causes eye movement abnormalities that may have a significant impact on patients’ disability. Inflammatory demyelinating lesions, especially occurring in the posterior fossa, result in a wide range of disorders, spanning from acquired pendular nystagmus (APN) to internuclear ophthalmoplegia (INO), among the most common. As the control of eye movements is well understood in terms of anatomical substrate and underlying physiological network, studying ocular motor abnormalities in MS provides a unique opportunity to gain insights into mechanisms of disease. Quantitative measurement and modeling of eye movement disorders, such as INO, may lead to a better understanding of common symptoms encountered in MS, such as Uhthoff’s phenomenon and fatigue. In turn, the pathophysiology of a range of eye movement abnormalities, such as APN, has been clarified based on correlation of experimental model with lesion localization by neuroimaging in MS. Eye movement disorders have the potential of being utilized as structural and functional biomarkers of early cognitive deficit, and possibly help in assessing disease status and progression, and to serve as platform and functional outcome to test novel therapeutic agents for MS. Knowledge of neuropharmacology applied to eye movement dysfunction has guided testing and use of a number of pharmacological agents to treat some eye movement disorders found in MS, such as APN and other forms of central nystagmus.},

  abstract = {Video-oculography (VOG) could be useful for monitoring neurodegenerative diseases and multiple sclerosis (MS), as a high prevalence of subclinical eye movements abnormalities (EMA) has been previously reported, with a potential prognostic value regarding disease evolution. However, access to VOG is limited in clinical practice.
To evaluate the reliability of VOG recordings performed using eVOG, a mobile application developed on an iPad.
Patients with MS or related disease without clinically detectable EMA were enrolled in a cross-sectional study during which two VOG exams (classical VOG and eVOG) were performed on the same day. We examined reflex saccades, antisaccades, smooth pursuit and fixation. The total number of deficits, saccadic latencies and velocities, qualitative smooth pursuit were compared.
30 patients were included. The mean number of EMA per patient on classical VOG was 4.1 and 2.3 on eVOG. We found a statistical association between the number of EMA for each exam (r = 0.66, p {\textless} 0.0001). Saccades latencies (r = 0.57, p {\textless} 0.0001) and velocities (r = 0.45, p {\textless} 0.0001) were also well correlated. Assessing eVOG accuracy, we found a sensitivity ranging from 44\% to 100\% and a specificity ranging from 71\% to 88.9\% depending on the considered abnormality.
eVOG could be an easily accessible solution to screen MS patients for the presence of EMA. We plan to use eVOG on a larger cohort of patients, in a prospective study to assess the prognostic value of subclinical EMA in MS. We also plan to investigate the use of eVOG in other neurological conditions
Eye movement abnormalities (EMA) are common in multiple sclerosis (MS). However, type and severity according to the MS stage are poorly known, especially in Radiologically Isolated Syndrome (RIS) and in Clinically Isolated Syndrome (CIS). Although MRI has been included in the MS diagnostic criteria, there may be clinical-radiological dissociation.
To analyze by video-oculography (VOG) prevalence of EMA in different MS phenotypes and study correlations with brain and cervical cord MRI T2 lesions location.
76 participants were prospectively recruited (12 RIS, 10 CIS, 11 relapsing-remitting-MS, 10 secondary progressive-MS, 10 primary progressive MS and 23 gender and age-matched healthy controls). We analyzed fixations, anti-saccades, horizontal and vertical reflex saccades and smooth pursuit.
EMA were frequent and of gradual severity from RIS to progressive forms. Internuclear ophthalmoplegia (INO) and centripetal hypermetria were strong arguments for the diagnosis of a demyelinating disorder versus a control population. Some EMA were linked to infratentorial T2 lesion location, but others like INO were not.
This study confirm that EMA are common in all MS phenotypes, even at the earliest stages. VOG can be useful to detect demyelinating process at preclinical stage by highlighting subclinical EMA even in absence of characteristic lesions visible on MRI.
Primary progressive aphasia (PPA) is a neurological syndrome, associated with both frontotemporal dementia and Alzheimer's disease, in which progressive language impairment emerges as the most salient clinical feature during the initial stages of disease.
We screened the main genes associated with Alzheimer's disease and frontotemporal dementia for pathogenic and risk variants in a cohort of 403 PPA cases.
In this case series study, 14 (3.5\%) cases carried (likely) pathogenic variants: four C9orf72 expansions, nine GRN, and one TARDBP mutation. Rare risk variants, TREM2 R47H and MAPT A152T, were associated with a three- to seven-fold increase in risk for PPA.
Our results show that while pathogenic variants within the most common dementia genes were rarely associated with PPA, these were found almost exclusively in GRN and C9orf72, suggesting that PPA is more TDP43- than tau-related in our series. This is consistent with the finding that PPA frequency in dominantly inherited dementias is the highest in kindreds with GRN variants.
Radiation-induced hypoglossal nerve palsy is a debilitating and irreversible late complication after definitive radiotherapy for nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) and other skull base tumors. This study sets to evaluate its incidence and clinical predictive factors, and to propose relevant dosimetric constraints for this structure to guide radiotherapy planning.
We undertook a retrospective review of 797 NPC patients who underwent definitive intensity-modulated radiotherapy (IMRT) between 2003 and 2011. Cumulative incidence and clinical predictors for radiation-induced hypoglossal nerve palsy were evaluated. Archived radiotherapy plans were retrieved and 330 independent hypoglossal nerves were retrospectively contoured following standardized atlas. Optimal threshold analyses of dosimetric parameters (Dmax, D0.5cc, D1cc, D2cc, Dmean) were conducted using receiver operating characteristic curves. Normal tissue complication probability was generated with logistic regression modeling.
With a median follow-up of 8.1 years, sixty-nine (8.7\%) patients developed radiation-induced hypoglossal nerve palsy. High radiotherapy dose, premorbid diabetes, advanced T-stage and radiological hypoglossal canal involvement were independent clinical risk factors. Maximum dose received by 1 cc volume (D1cc) was the best predictor for the development of radiation-induced nerve palsy (AUC = 0.826) at 8 years after IMRT. Hypoglossal nerves with D1cc of 74 Gy EQD2 had an estimated palsy risk of 4.7\%. Nerves with D1cc {\textless}74 Gy EQD2 had significantly lower risk of palsy than those ≥74 Gy EQD2 (2.4\% vs 20.8\%, p {\textless}0.001).
Incidence of radiation-induced hypoglossal nerve palsy was high after definitive IMRT for NPC. D1cc {\textless}74 Gy EQD2 can serve as a useful dose constraint to adopt during radiotherapy planning to limit palsy risk to {\textless}5\% at 8 years after IMRT.
Although the Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS) is the “gold-standard” tool in assessing the severity of symptoms in patients with Parkinson's disease (PD), not all activity-related disease symptoms can be accurately captured by the well-established clinical rating scale. Using an alternative approach, this study examined the level of physical activity measured by actigraphy over time and whether change in physical activity was associated with disease severity assessed by UPDRS.
We used a longitudinal design in which physical activity and disease severity were assessed repeatedly during a 4-month interval, over a 3-year observational period, in a sample of 61 patients with idiopathic PD and a control group of 32 neurologically intact individuals. Physical activity data during awake-time were analyzed using the power-law exponent (PLE) method. Correlational relationships between changes in maxima values of PLE and scores of total UPDRS, UPDRS—part II (Activities of Daily Living), and UPDRS—part III (Motor Examination) in patients with PD were examined. Results show an increase in maxima values of PLE and the UPDRS total score in PD patients and that there is a positive association between changes in maxima values and total UPDRS score (r = 0.746, p = 0.032), UPDRS—part II score (r = 0.687, p = 0.027), and UPDRS—part III score (r = 0.893, p = 0.018). There was no significant change in the level of physical activity over time for the controls.
Findings from this study indicate that change in physical activity, as captured by actigraphy, is associated with increased severity in patients' clinical symptoms of PD over time. Thus, these data suggest that, when used in conjunction with the conventional UPDRS measure, an actigraphic measure of physical activity may provide clinicians an adjunct measurement approach to monitor patients' activity-based disease progression or responses to treatment in outpatient clinic settings.
Acquired pendular nystagmus is comprised of quasi-sinusoidal oscillations of the eyes significantly affecting gaze holding and clarity of vision. The most common causes of acquired pendular nystagmus include demyelinating disorders such as multiple sclerosis and the syndrome of ocular palatal tremor. However, several other deficits, such as pharmacological intoxication, metabolic and genetic disorders, and granulomatous disorders can lead to syndromes mimicking acquired pendular nystagmus. Study of the kinematic features of acquired pendular nystagmus has suggested a putative pathophysiology of an otherwise mysterious neurological disorder. Here we review clinical features of neurological deficits that co-occur with acquired pendular nystagmus. Subsequent discussion of the pathophysiology of individual forms of pendular nystagmus speculates on mechanisms of the underlying disease while providing insights into pharmacotherapy of nystagmus.
This article reports a patient with acquired hepatocerebral degeneration that presented with progressive cerebellar ataxia, cerebellar atrophy, and middle cerebellar peduncle lesions. He had a marked improvement after liver transplantation. We reinforce that hepatic failure should be investigated in patients with pure cerebellar syndrome, resembling neurodegenerative diseases.},

                   motor system for communication (e.g., 'locked-in'
                   patients). The 26 letters of the alphabet, together
                   with several other symbols and commands, are
                   displayed on a computer screen which serves as the
                   keyboard or prosthetic device. The subject focuses
                   attention successively on the characters he wishes to
                   communicate. The computer detects the chosen
                   character on-line and in real time. This detection is
                   achieved by repeatedly flashing rows and columns of
                   the matrix. When the dements containing the chosen
                   character are flashed, a P300 is elicited, and it is
                   this P300 that is detected by the computer. We report
                   an analysis of the operating characteristics of the
                   system when used with normal volunteers, who took
                   part in 2 experimental sessions. In the first session
                   (the pilot study/training session) subjects attempted
                   to spell a word and convey it to a voice synthesizer
                   for production. In the second session (the analysis
                   of the operating characteristics of the system)
                   subjects were required simply to attend to individual
                   letters of a word for a specific number of trials
                   while data were recorded for off-line analysis. The
                   analyses suggest that this communication channel can
                   be operated accurately at the rate of 0.20 bits/sec.

                   be described mathematically as the result of randomly
                   distributed dipoles representing the interactions of
                   cortical neurons. If the dipoles are in a spherical
                   volume conductor and have no preference for any
                   direction, the variance of a differentially measured
                   EEG signal is only a function of the electrode
                   distance. The theoretically derived variance function
                   is compared with EEG and MEG measurements. It is
                   shown that a dipole with a fixed position and a
                   randomly fluctuating amplitude is an adequate model
                   for the alpha -rhythm. An expression for the
                   covariance between the magnetic field and a
                   differentially measured EEG signal is derived. This
                   covariance is considered as a function of the
                   magnetometer position. The theory can be used to
                   obtain a (spatial) covariance matrix of the

  abstract = {We investigated the potential of the Utah
                   Intracortical Electrode Array (UIEA) to provide
                   signals for a brain-computer interface (BCI). The
                   UIEA records from small populations of neurons which
                   have an average signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of 6:1.
                   We provide specific examples that show the activities
                   of these populations of neurons contain sufficient
                   information to perform control tasks. Results from a
                   simple stimulus detection task using these signals as
                   inputs confirm that the number of neurons present in
                   a recording is significant in determining task
                   performance. Increasing the number of units in a
                   recording decreases the sensitivity of the response
                   to the stimulus; decreasing the number of units in
                   the recording, however, increases the variability of
                   the response to the stimulus. We conclude that
                   recordings from small populations of neurons, not
                   single units, provide a reliable source of
                   sufficiently stimulus selective signals which should
                   be suitable for a BCI. In addition, the potential for
                   simultaneous and proportional control of a large
                   number of external devices may be realized through
                   the ability of an array of microelectrodes such as
                   the UIEA to record both spatial and temporal patterns
                   of neuronal activation.},

  abstract  = {A spatial filtering method for localizing sources of
                   brain electrical activity from surface recordings is
                   described and analyzed. The spatial filters are
                   implemented as a weighted sum of the data recorded at
                   different sites. The weights are chosen to minimize
                   the filter output power subject to a linear
                   constraint. The linear constraint forces the filter
                   to pass brain electrical activity from a specified
                   location, while the power minimization attenuates
                   activity originating at other locations. The
                   estimated output power as a function of location is
                   normalized by the estimated noise power as a function
                   of location to obtain a neural activity index map.
                   Locations of source activity correspond to maxima in
                   the neural activity index map. The method does not
                   require any prior assumptions about the number of
                   active sources of their geometry because it exploits
                   the spatial covariance of the source electrical
                   activity. This paper presents a development and
                   analysis of the method and explores its sensitivity
                   to deviations between actual and assumed data models.
                   The effect on the algorithm of covariance matrix
                   estimation, correlation between sources, and choice
                   of reference is discussed. Simulated and measured
                   data is used to illustrate the efficacy of the

                   his or her head produces EEG-signals, even when he or

                   are irregular and it is impossible to predict how the
                   signal will evolve in time with only the knowledge of
                   their behavior in the past. This impossibility does
                   not imply that the signals are completely random,
                   because often characteristic rhythms can be observed
                   when the condition of the subject is changed. A well
                   known example is the appearance of the alpha-rhythm
                   when the subject closes his eyes (e.g. Lopes da
                   Silva, 1987). The precise shape of these EEG signals
                   can not be predicted and the exact knowledge is not
                   very useful. A meaningful description of spontaneous
                   EEG signals can only be given in terms of their
                   statistical properties. The same is true for the
                   behavior of the EEG signals in the space domain. EEG
                   maps can vary from very regular and dipolar patters
                   to very irregular patterns that do not easily reveal
                   where the underlying generators are located. To
                   characterize the maps of spontaneous EEG one has to

                   algebra that supports a wide range of fast, elegant,

                   scientific computing suggest that this important
                   matrix operation will have an increasingly greater
                   role to play in the future. First, the application
                   areas where Kronecker products abound are all
                   thriving. These include signal processing, image
                   processing, semidefinite programming, and quantum
                   computing. Second, sparse factorizations and
                   Kronecker products are proving to be a very effective
                   way to look at fast linear transforms. Researchers
                   have taken the Kronecker methodology as developed for
                   the fast Fourier transform and used it to build
                   exciting alternatives. Third, as computers get more
                   powerful, researchers are more willing to entertain
                   problems of high dimension and this leads to
                   Kronecker products whenever low-dimension techniques

                   electroencephalographic activity or other
                   electrophysiological measures of brain function might
                   provide a new non-muscular channel for sending
                   messages and commands to the external world -- a
                   brain-computer interface (BCI). Over the past 15
                   years, productive BCI research programs have arisen.
                   Encouraged by new understanding of brain function, by
                   the advent of powerful low-cost computer equipment,
                   and by growing recognition of the needs and
                   potentials of people with disabilities, these
                   programs concentrate on developing new augmentative
                   communication and control technology for those with
                   severe neuromuscular disorders, such as amyotrophic
                   lateral sclerosis, brainstem stroke, and spinal cord
                   injury. The immediate goal is to provide these users,
                   who may be completely paralyzed, or ‘locked in’,
                   with basic communication capabilities so that they
                   can express their wishes to caregivers or even
                   operate word processing programs or neuroprostheses.
                   Present-day BCIs determine the intent of the user
                   from a variety of different electrophysiological
                   signals. These signals include slow cortical
                   potentials, P300 potentials, and mu or beta rhythms
                   recorded from the scalp, and cortical neuronal
                   activity recorded by implanted electrodes. They are
                   translated in real-time into commands that operate a
                   computer display or other device. Successful
                   operation requires that the user encode commands in
                   these signals and that the BCI derive the commands
                   from the signals. Thus, the user and the BCI system
                   need to adapt to each other both initially and
                   continually so as to ensure stable performance.
                   Current BCIs have maximum information transfer rates
                   up to 10–25 bits/min. This limited capacity can be
                   valuable for people whose severe disabilities prevent
                   them from using conventional augmentative
                   communication methods. At the same time, many
                   possible applications of BCI technology, such as
                   neuroprosthesis control, may require higher
                   information transfer rates. Future progress will
                   depend on: recognition that BCI research and
                   development is an interdisciplinary problem,
                   involving neurobiology, psychology, engineering,
                   mathematics, and computer science; identification of
                   those signals, whether evoked potentials, spontaneous
                   rhythms, or neuronal firing rates, that users are
                   best able to control independent of activity in
                   conventional motor output pathways; development of
                   training methods for helping users to gain and
                   maintain that control; delineation of the best
                   algorithms for translating these signals into device
                   commands; attention to the identification and
                   elimination of artifacts such as electromyographic
                   and electro-oculographic activity; adoption of
                   precise and objective procedures for evaluating BCI
                   performance; recognition of the need for long-term as
                   well as short-term assessment of BCI performance;
                   identification of appropriate BCI applications and
                   appropriate matching of applications and users; and
                   attention to factors that affect user acceptance of
                   augmentative technology, including ease of use,
                   cosmesis, and provision of those communication and
                   control capacities that are most important to the
                   user. Development of BCI technology will also benefit
                   from greater emphasis on peer-reviewed research
                   publications and avoidance of the hyperbolic and
                   often misleading media attention that tends to
                   generate unrealistic expectations in the public and
                   skepticism in other researchers. With adequate
                   recognition and effective engagement of all these
                   issues, BCI systems could eventually provide an
                   important new communication and control option for
                   those with motor disabilities and might also give
                   those without disabilities a supplementary control
                   channel or a control channel useful in special
                   circumstances.},

  abstract = {The general spatiotemporal covariance matrix of the
                   background noise in MEG/EEG signals is huge. To
                   reduce the dimensionality of this matrix it is
                   modeled as a Kronecker product of a spatial and a
                   temporal covariance matrix. When the number of time
                   samples is larger than, say, J = 500, the iterative
                   Maximum Likelihood estimation of these two matrices
                   is still too time-consuming to be useful on a routine
                   basis. In this study we looked for methods to
                   circumvent this computationally expensive procedure
                   by using a parametric model with subject-dependent
                   parameters. Such a model would additionally help with
                   interpreting MEG/EEG signals. For the spatial
                   covariance, models have been derived already and it
                   has been shown that measured MEG/EEG signals can be
                   understood spatially as random processes, generated
                   by random dipoles. The temporal covariance, however,
                   has not been modeled yet, therefore we studied the
                   temporal covariance matrix in several subjects. For
                   all subjects the temporal covariance shows an alpha
                   oscillation and vanishes for large time lag. This
                   gives rise to a temporal noise model consisting of
                   two components: alpha activity and additional random
                   noise. The alpha activity is modeled as randomly
                   occurring waves with random phase and the covariance
                   of the additional noise decreases exponentially with
                   lag. This model requires only six parameters instead
                   of 12 J(J + 1). Theoretically, this model is
                   stationary but in practice the stationarity of the
                   matrix is highly influenced by the baseline
                   correction. It appears that very good agreement
                   between the data and the parametric model can be
                   obtained when the baseline correction window is taken
                   into account properly. This finding implies that the
                   background noise is in principle a stationary process
                   and that nonstationarities are mainly caused by the
                   nature of the preprocessing method. When analyzing
                   events at a fixed sample after the stimulus (e.g.,
                   the SEF N20 response) one can take advantage of this
                   nonstationarity by optimizing the baseline window to
                   obtain a low noise variance at this particular
                   sample.},

                   estimator that is not only invertible, but also
                   well-conditioned (that is, inverting it does not
                   amplify estimation error). For large-dimensional
                   covariance matrices, the usual estimator—the sample
                   covariance matrix—is typically not well-conditioned
                   and may not even be invertible. This paper introduces
                   an estimator that is both well-conditioned and more
                   accurate than the sample covariance matrix
                   asymptotically. This estimator is distribution-free
                   and has a simple explicit formula that is easy to
                   compute and interpret. It is the asymptotically
                   optimal convex linear combination of the sample
                   covariance matrix with the identity matrix.
                   Optimality is meant with respect to a quadratic loss
                   function, asymptotically as the number of
                   observations and the number of variables go to
                   infinity together. Extensive Monte Carlo confirm that

  abstract  = {{Motivation: Genetic networks are often described
                   statistically using graphical models (e.g. Bayesian
                   networks). However, inferring the network structure
                   offers a serious challenge in microarray analysis
                   where the sample size is small compared to the number
                   of considered genes. This renders many standard
                   algorithms for graphical models inapplicable, and
                   inferring genetic networks an ‘ill-posed’ inverse
                   problem.Methods: We introduce a novel framework for
                   small-sample inference of graphical models from gene
                   expression data. Specifically, we focus on the
                   so-called graphical Gaussian models (GGMs) that are
                   now frequently used to describe gene association
                   networks and to detect conditionally dependent genes.
                   Our new approach is based on (1) improved
                   (regularized) small-sample point estimates of partial
                   correlation, (2) an exact test of edge inclusion with
                   adaptive estimation of the degree of freedom and (3)
                   a heuristic network search based on false discovery
                   rate multiple testing. Steps (2) and (3) correspond
                   to an empirical Bayes estimate of the network
                   topology.Results: Using computer simulations, we
                   investigate the sensitivity (power) and specificity
                   (true negative rate) of the proposed framework to
                   estimate GGMs from microarray data. This shows that
                   it is possible to recover the true network topology
                   with high accuracy even for small-sample datasets.
                   Subsequently, we analyze gene expression data from a
                   breast cancer tumor study and illustrate our approach
                   by inferring a corresponding large-scale gene
                   association network for 3883 genes.Availability: The

                   system that operates by detecting a P300 elicited by
                   one of four randomly presented stimuli (i.e. YES, NO,
                   PASS, END). Methods Two groups of participants were
                   tested. The first group included three amyotrophic
                   lateral sclerosis (ALS) patients that varied in
                   degree of disability, but all retained the ability to
                   communicate; the second group included three non-ALS
                   controls. Each participant participated in ten
                   experimental sessions during a period of
                   approximately 6 weeks. During each run the
                   participant's task was to attend to one stimulus and
                   disregard the other three. Stimuli were presented
                   auditorily, visually, or in both modes. Results Two
                   of the 3 ALS patient's classification rates were
                   equal to those achieved by the non-ALS participants.
                   Waveform morphology varied as a function of the
                   presentation mode, but not in a similar pattern for
                   each participant. Conclusions The event-related
                   potentials elicited by the target stimuli could be
                   discriminated from the non-target stimuli for the
                   non-ALS and the ALS groups. Future studies will begin
                   to examine online classification. Significance The
                   results of offline classification suggest that a
                   P300-based BCI can serve as a non-muscular
                   communication device in both ALS, and non-ALS control

                   communicating intentions by mere brain activity, not
                   involving muscles. Thus, BCIs may offer patients who
                   have lost all voluntary muscle control the only
                   possible way to communicate. Many recent studies have
                   demonstrated that BCIs based on
                   electroencephalography (EEG) can allow healthy and
                   severely paralyzed individuals to communicate. While
                   this approach is safe and inexpensive, communication
                   is slow. Magnetoencephalography (MEG) provides
                   signals with higher spatiotemporal resolution than
                   EEG and could thus be used to explore whether these
                   improved signal properties translate into increased
                   BCI communication speed. In this study, we
                   investigated the utility of an MEG-based BCI that
                   uses voluntary amplitude modulation of sensorimotor
                   μ and β rhythms. To increase the signal-to-noise
                   ratio, we present a simple spatial filtering method
                   that takes the geometric properties of signal
                   propagation in MEG into account, and we present
                   methods that can process artifacts specifically
                   encountered in an MEG-based BCI. Exemplarily, six
                   participants were successfully trained to communicate
                   binary decisions by imagery of limb movements using a
                   feedback paradigm. Participants achieved significant
                   μ rhythm self control within 32 min of feedback
                   training. For a subgroup of three participants, we
                   localized the origin of the amplitude modulated
                   signal to the motor cortex. Our results suggest that
                   an MEG-based BCI is feasible and efficient in terms

                   estimation for elliptical distributed samples, which
                   are also known as spherically invariant random
                   vectors (SIRV) or compound-Gaussian processes and
                   proposes a simple, closed-form and data dependent
                   choice for the shrinkage coefficient, based on a
                   minimum mean squared error framework. We address high
                   dimensional covariance estimation for elliptical
                   distributed samples, which are also known as
                   spherically invariant random vectors (SIRV) or
                   compound-Gaussian processes. Specifically we consider
                   shrinkage methods that are suitable for high
                   dimensional problems with a small number of samples
                   (large p small n). We start from a classical robust
                   covariance estimator [Tyler (1987)], which is
                   distribution-free within the family of elliptical
                   distribution but inapplicable when n {\textless}; p.
                   Using a shrinkage coefficient, we regularize Tyler's
                   fixed-point iterations. We prove that, for all n and
                   p , the proposed fixed-point iterations converge to a
                   unique limit regardless of the initial condition.
                   Next, we propose a simple, closed-form and data
                   dependent choice for the shrinkage coefficient, which
                   is based on a minimum mean squared error framework.

  abstract  = {Background In a visual oddball paradigm, attention to
                   an event usually modulates the event-related
                   potential (ERP). An ERP-based brain-computer
                   interface (BCI) exploits this neural mechanism for
                   communication. Hitherto, it was unclear to what
                   extent the accuracy of such a BCI requires eye
                   movements (overt attention) or whether it is also
                   feasible for targets in the visual periphery (covert
                   attention). Also unclear was how the visual design of
                   the BCI can be improved to meet peculiarities of
                   peripheral vision such as low spatial acuity and
                   crowding. Method Healthy participants (N = 13)
                   performed a copy-spelling task wherein they had to
                   count target intensifications. EEG and eye movements
                   were recorded concurrently. First, (c)overt attention
                   was investigated by way of a target fixation
                   condition and a central fixation condition. In the
                   latter, participants had to fixate a dot in the
                   center of the screen and allocate their attention to
                   a target in the visual periphery. Second, the effect
                   of visual speller layout was investigated by
                   comparing the symbol Matrix to an ERP-based
                   Hex-o-Spell, a two-levels speller consisting of six
                   discs arranged on an invisible hexagon. Results We
                   assessed counting errors, ERP amplitudes, and offline
                   classification performance. There is an advantage
                   (i.e., less errors, larger ERP amplitude modulation,
                   better classification) of overt attention over covert
                   attention, and there is also an advantage of the
                   Hex-o-Spell over the Matrix. Using overt attention,
                   P1, N1, P2, N2, and P3 components are enhanced by
                   attention. Using covert attention, only N2 and P3 are
                   enhanced for both spellers, and N1 and P2 are
                   modulated when using the Hex-o-Spell but not when
                   using the Matrix. Consequently, classifiers rely
                   mainly on early evoked potentials in overt attention
                   and on later cognitive components in covert
                   attention. Conclusions Both overt and covert
                   attention can be used to drive an ERP-based BCI, but
                   performance is markedly lower for covert attention.
                   The Hex-o-Spell outperforms the Matrix, especially
                   when eye movements are not permitted, illustrating
                   that performance can be increased if one accounts for
                   peculiarities of peripheral vision.},

  abstract = {Many studies over the past two decades have shown
                   that people and animals can use brain signals to
                   convey their intent to a computer using
                   brain-computer interfaces (BCIs). BCI systems measure
                   specific features of brain activity and translate
                   them into control signals that drive an output. The
                   sensor modalities that have most commonly been used
                   in BCI studies have been electroencephalographic
                   (EEG) recordings from the scalp and single-neuron
                   recordings from within the cortex. Over the past
                   decade, an increasing number of studies has explored
                   the use of electrocorticographic (ECoG) activity
                   recorded directly from the surface of the brain. ECoG
                   has attracted substantial and increasing interest,
                   because it has been shown to reflect specific details
                   of actual and imagined actions, and because its
                   technical characteristics should readily support
                   robust and chronic implementations of BCI systems in
                   humans. This review provides general perspectives on
                   the ECoG platform; describes the different
                   electrophysiological features that can be detected in
                   ECoG; elaborates on the signal acquisition issues,
                   protocols, and online performance of ECoG-based BCI
                   studies to date; presents important limitations of
                   current ECoG studies; discusses opportunities for
                   further research; and finally presents a vision for
                   eventual clinical implementation. In summary, the
                   studies presented to date strongly encourage further
                   research using the ECoG platform for basic
                   neuroscientific research, as well as for
                   translational neuroprosthetic applications.},

                   related potentials (ERPs) on a single trial basis is
                   a hard problem due to the high trial-to-trial
                   variability and the unfavorable ratio between signal
                   (ERP) and noise (artifacts and neural background
                   activity). In this tutorial, we provide a
                   comprehensive framework for decoding ERPs,
                   elaborating on linear concepts, namely
                   spatio-temporal patterns and filters as well as
                   linear ERP classification. However, the bottleneck of
                   these techniques is that they require an accurate
                   covariance matrix estimation in high dimensional
                   sensor spaces which is a highly intricate problem. As
                   a remedy, we propose to use shrinkage estimators and
                   show that appropriate regularization of linear
                   discriminant analysis (LDA) by shrinkage yields
                   excellent results for single-trial ERP classification
                   that are far superior to classical LDA

                   on the interpretation of what classifiers learned
                   from the data and demonstrate in particular that the
                   trade-off between goodness-of-fit and model
                   complexity in regularized LDA relates to a morphing
                   between a difference pattern of ERPs and a spatial
                   filter which cancels non task-related brain
                   activity.},

                   However, recent neuroimaging research demonstrates

                   neuroscience, neural engineering, and clinical
                   rehabilitation. While the performance of BCI systems
                   has improved, they do not yet support widespread
                   usage. Recently, visual and auditory BCI systems have
                   become popular because of their high communication
                   speeds, little user training, and low user variation.

                   related potentials (ERP) in brain computer interfaces
                   (BCI). The classical oddball paradigm is usually used
                   to evoke the P300 from Electroencephalogram (EEG)
                   signals. However, EEG raw data are noisy which make
                   the P300 detection very difficult. In this paper, we
                   aim to detect the P300 wave as accurate as possible
                   using appropriate feature extraction method combined
                   with powerful classifier. We compared four methods:
                   Kernel principal component analysis (KPCA), Principal
                   component analysis (PCA), Independent component
                   analysis (ICA) and Linear discriminant analysis
                   (LDA). Each method is used with a linear support
                   vector machine (SVM) classifier and tested on EEG
                   signals from three channels (FZ, CZ and PZ) of four

                   spatio-temporal covariance matrices in the low sample
                   non-Gaussian regime. We impose covariance structure
                   in the form of a sum of Kronecker products
                   decomposition [1, 2] with diagonal correction [2],
                   which we refer to as DC-KronPCA, in the estimation of
                   multiframe covariance matrices. This paper extends
                   the approaches of [1] in two directions. First, we
                   modify the diagonally corrected method of [2] to
                   include a block Toeplitz constraint imposing temporal
                   stationarity structure. Second, we improve the
                   conditioning of the estimate in the very low sample
                   regime by using Ledoit-Wolf type shrinkage
                   regular-ization similar to [3]. For improved
                   robustness to heavy tailed distributions, we modify
                   the KronPCA to incorporate robust shrinkage

                   establish benefits in terms of estimation MSE when

                   neuroimaging devices is accompanied by a trend
                   towards more powerful multivariate analysis methods.
                   Often it is desired to interpret the outcome of these
                   methods with respect to the cognitive processes under
                   study. Here we discuss which methods allow for such
                   interpretations, and provide guidelines for choosing
                   an appropriate analysis for a given experimental
                   goal: For a surgeon who needs to decide where to
                   remove brain tissue it is most important to determine
                   the origin of cognitive functions and associated
                   neural processes. In contrast, when communicating
                   with paralyzed or comatose patients via
                   brain-computer interfaces, it is most important to
                   accurately extract the neural processes specific to a
                   certain mental state. These equally important but
                   complementary objectives require different analysis
                   methods. Determining the origin of neural processes
                   in time or space from the parameters of a data-driven
                   model requires what we call a forward model of the
                   data; such a model explains how the measured data was
                   generated from the neural sources. Examples are
                   general linear models (GLMs). Methods for the
                   extraction of neural information from data can be
                   considered as backward models, as they attempt to
                   reverse the data generating process. Examples are
                   multivariate classifiers. Here we demonstrate that
                   the parameters of forward models are
                   neurophysiologically interpretable in the sense that
                   significant nonzero weights are only observed at
                   channels the activity of which is related to the
                   brain process under study. In contrast, the
                   interpretation of backward model parameters can lead
                   to wrong conclusions regarding the spatial or
                   temporal origin of the neural signals of interest,
                   since significant nonzero weights may also be
                   observed at channels the activity of which is
                   statistically independent of the brain process under
                   study. As a remedy for the linear case, we propose a
                   procedure for transforming backward models into
                   forward models. This procedure enables the
                   neurophysiological interpretation of the parameters
                   of linear backward models. We hope that this work
                   raises awareness for an often encountered problem and
                   provides a theoretical basis for conducting better
                   interpretable multivariate neuroimaging analyses.},

  abstract  = {Goal: For statistical analysis of event-related
                   potentials (ERPs), there are convincing arguments
                   against averaging across stimuli or subjects.
                   Multivariate filters can be used to isolate an ERP
                   component of interest without the averaging
                   procedure. However, we would like to have certainty
                   that the output of the filter accurately represents
                   the component. Methods: We extended the linearly
                   constrained minimum variance (LCMV) beamformer, which
                   is traditionally used as a spatial filter for source
                   localization, to be a flexible spatiotemporal filter
                   for estimating the amplitude of ERP components in
                   sensor space. In a comparison study on both simulated
                   and real data, we demonstrated the strengths and
                   weaknesses of the beamformer as well as a range of
                   supervised learning approaches. Results: In the
                   context of measuring the amplitude of a specific ERP
                   component on a single-trial basis, we found that the
                   spatiotemporal LCMV beamformer is a filter that
                   accurately captures the component of interest, even
                   in the presence of both structured noise (e.g., other
                   overlapping ERP components) and unstructured noise
                   (e.g., ongoing brain activity and sensor noise).
                   Conclusion: The spatiotemporal LCMV beamformer method
                   provides an accurate and intuitive way to conduct
                   analysis of a known ERP component, without averaging
                   across trials or subjects. Significance: Eliminating
                   averaging allows us to test more detailed hypotheses
                   and apply more powerful statistical models. For
                   example, it allows the usage of multilevel regression
                   models that can incorporate between subject/stimulus
                   variation as random effects, test multiple effects
                   simultaneously, and control confounding effects by
                   partial regression.},

                   analysis (LDA). The optimization problems in LDA and

                   LDA beamformer is robust to correlated sources and
                   offers a higher signal-to-noise ratio than the LCMV
                   beamformer and PCA. As an application, we use EEG
                   data from an oddball experiment to show how the LDA
                   beamformer can be harnessed to detect single-trial
                   ERP latencies and estimate connectivity between ERP
                   sources. Concluding, the LDA beamformer optimally
                   reconstructs ERP sources by maximizing the ERP
                   signal-to-noise ratio. Hence, it is a highly suited
                   tool for analyzing ERP source time series,
                   particularly in EEG/MEG studies wherein a source
                   model is not available.},

                   activity with the aim to establish a direct
                   communication channel with an external device. Albeit
                   they have been hailed to (re-)establish communication
                   in persons suffering from severe motor- and/or
                   communication disabilities, only recently BCI
                   applications have been challenging other assistive
                   technologies. Owing to their considerably increased
                   performance and the advent of affordable
                   technological solutions, BCI technology is expected
                   to trigger a paradigm shift not only in assistive
                   technology but also in the way we will interface with
                   technology. However, the flipside of the quest for
                   accuracy and speed is most evident in EEG-based
                   visual BCI where it has led to a gamut of
                   increasingly complex classifiers, tailored to the
                   needs of specific stimulation paradigms and use
                   contexts. In this contribution, we argue that
                   spatiotemporal beamforming can serve several
                   synchronous visual BCI paradigms. We demonstrate this
                   for three popular visual paradigms even without
                   attempting to optimizing their electrode sets. For
                   each selectable target, a spatiotemporal beamformer
                   is applied to assess whether the corresponding
                   signal-of-interest is present in the preprocessed
                   multichannel EEG signals. The target with the highest
                   beamformer output is then selected by the decoder
                   (maximum selection). In addition to this simple
                   selection rule, we also investigated whether
                   interactions between beamformer outputs could be
                   employed to increase accuracy by combining the
                   outputs for all targets into a feature vector and
                   applying three common classification algorithms. The
                   results show that the accuracy of spatiotemporal
                   beamforming with maximum selection is at par with
                   that of the classification algorithms and
                   interactions between beamformer outputs do not
                   further improve that accuracy.},

                   versions of a pseudorandom binary sequence of
                   luminance changes, the EEG signal recorded over the
                   viewer’s occipital pole exhibits so-called
                   code-modulated visual evoked potentials (cVEPs), the
                   phase lags of which can be tied to these targets. The

                   reported high information transfer rates (ITR, in
                   bits/min). In this study, we introduce a novel
                   decoding algorithm based on spatiotemporal
                   beamforming, and show that this algorithm is able to
                   accurately identify the gazed target. Especially for
                   a small number of repetitions of the coding sequence,
                   our beamforming approach significantly outperforms an
                   optimised support vector machine (SVM)-based
                   classifier, which is considered state-of-the-art in
                   cVEP-based BCI. In addition to the traditional 60 Hz
                   stimulus presentation rate for the coding sequence,
                   we also explore the 120 Hz rate, and show that the
                   latter enables faster communication, with a maximal
                   median ITR of 172.87 bits/min. Finally, we also
                   report on a transition effect in the EEG signal
                   following the onset of the stimulus sequence, and
                   recommend to exclude the first 150 ms of the trials
                   from decoding when relying on a single presentation
                   of the stimulus sequence.},

                   the number of training samples smaller than the
                   dimensionality. This paper investigates parameter
                   choice for linear shrinkage estimators. We propose
                   data-driven, leave-one-out cross-validation (LOOCV)
                   methods for automatically choosing the shrinkage
                   coefficients, aiming to minimize the Frobenius norm
                   of the estimation error. A quadratic loss is used as
                   the prediction error for LOOCV. The resulting
                   solutions can be found analytically or by solving
                   optimization problems of small sizes and thus have
                   low complexities. Our proposed methods are compared
                   with various existing techniques. We show that the

                   shrinkage designs using sample covariance matrix
                   (SCM) and several typical shrinkage targets.
                   Furthermore, the LOOCV method provides low-complexity
                   solutions for estimators that use general shrinkage
                   targets, multiple targets, and/or ordinary least
                   squares (OLS)-based covariance matrix estimation. We
                   also show applications of our proposed techniques to

                   the past decade have led to exciting developments in
                   brain–computer interface (BCI), thereby making BCI
                   a top research area in applied science. The
                   renaissance of BCI opens new methods of
                   neurorehabilitation for physically disabled people
                   (e.g. paralyzed patients and amputees) and patients
                   with brain injuries (e.g. stroke patients). Recent
                   technological advances such as wireless recording,
                   machine learning analysis, and real-time temporal
                   resolution have increased interest in
                   electroencephalographic (EEG) based BCI approaches.
                   Many BCI studies have focused on decoding EEG signals
                   associated with whole-body kinematics/kinetics, motor
                   imagery, and various senses. Thus, there is a need to
                   understand the various experimental paradigms used in
                   EEG-based BCI systems. Moreover, given that there are
                   many available options, it is essential to choose the
                   most appropriate BCI application to properly
                   manipulate a neuroprosthetic or neurorehabilitation
                   device. The current review evaluates EEG-based BCI
                   paradigms regarding their advantages and
                   disadvantages from a variety of perspectives. For
                   each paradigm, various EEG decoding algorithms and
                   classification methods are evaluated. The
                   applications of these paradigms with targeted
                   patients are summarized. Finally, potential problems
                   with EEG-based BCI systems are discussed, and
                   possible solutions are proposed.},

                   control devices, machines and prostheses with their
                   thoughts. Most feasibility studies with BCIs have
                   utilized scalp electroencephalography (EEG), due to
                   it being accessible, noninvasive, and portable. While
                   BCIs have been studied with magnetoencephalography
                   (MEG), the modality has limited applications due to
                   the large immobile hardware. Here we propose that
                   room-temperature, optically-pumped magnetometers
                   (OPMs) can potentially serve a portable modality that
                   can be used for BCIs. OPMs have the added advantage
                   that low-frequency neuromagnetic fields are not
                   affected by volume conduction, which is known to
                   distort EEG signals. In this feasibility study, we
                   tested an OPM system with a real-time BCI where able
                   bodied participants controlled a cursor to reach two
                   targets. This BCI system used alpha and beta-band
                   power modulations associated with hand movements. Our
                   preliminary results show significant alpha and
                   beta-band desynchronization due to movement, as found
                   in previous literature.},

                   processing systems, which directly operate on
                   neuronal signals to identify specific human intents.
                   These systems can be applied to overcome certain
                   disabilities or to enhance the natural capabilities
                   of human beings. The visual P300 mind-speller is a
                   prominent one among them, which has opened up
                   tremendous possibilities in movement and
                   communication applications. Today, there exist many
                   state-of-the-art visual P300 mind-speller
                   implementations in the literature as a result of
                   numerous researches in this domain over the past 2
                   decades. Each of these systems can be evaluated in
                   terms of performance metrics like classification
                   accuracy, information transfer rate, and processing
                   time. Various classification techniques associated
                   with these systems, which include but are not limited
                   to discriminant analysis, support vector machine,
                   neural network, distance-based and ensemble of
                   classifiers, have major roles in determining the
                   overall system performances. The significance of a
                   proper review on the recent developments in visual
                   P300 mind-spellers with proper emphasis on their
                   classification algorithms is the key insight for this

                   Autistic Spectrum Disorder (ASD). Recently, there was

                   Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to decode P300

                   transformation by being exposed to examples of input
                   with the desired output, forming the basis for a
                   variety of powerful techniques for analyzing
                   neuroimaging data. However, their ability to learn
                   the desired transformation is limited by the quality
                   and size of the example dataset, which in
                   neuroimaging studies is often notoriously noisy and
                   small. In these cases, it is desirable to fine-tune
                   the learned linear model using domain information
                   beyond the example dataset. To this end, we present a
                   framework that decomposes the weight matrix of a
                   fitted linear model into three subcomponents: the
                   data covariance, the identified signal of interest,
                   and a normalizer. Inspecting these subcomponents in
                   isolation provides an intuitive way to inspect the
                   inner workings of the model and assess its strengths
                   and weaknesses. Furthermore, the three subcomponents
                   may be altered, which provides a straightforward way
                   to inject prior information and impose additional
                   constraints. We refer to this process as “post-hoc
                   modification” of a model and demonstrate how it can
                   be used to achieve precise control over which aspects
                   of the model are fitted to the data through machine
                   learning and which are determined through domain
                   information. As an example use case, we decode the
                   associative strength between words from
                   electroencephalography (EEG) reading data. Our
                   results show how the decoding accuracy of two example
                   linear models (ridge regression and logistic
                   regression) can be boosted by incorporating
                   information about the spatio-temporal nature of the
                   data, domain information about the N400 evoked
                   potential and data from other participants.},

                   communication to people who have lost the ability to
                   move or speak. So far, a major focus of BCI research
                   has been on restoring gross motor skills, such as
                   reaching and grasping1–5 or point-and-click typing
                   with a computer cursor6,7. However, rapid sequences
                   of highly dexterous behaviours, such as handwriting
                   or touch typing, might enable faster rates of
                   communication. Here we developed an intracortical BCI
                   that decodes attempted handwriting movements from
                   neural activity in the motor cortex and translates it
                   to text in real time, using a recurrent neural
                   network decoding approach. With this BCI, our study
                   participant, whose hand was paralysed from spinal
                   cord injury, achieved typing speeds of 90 characters
                   per minute with 94.1\% raw accuracy online, and
                   greater than 99\% accuracy offline with a
                   general-purpose autocorrect. To our knowledge, these
                   typing speeds exceed those reported for any other
                   BCI, and are comparable to typical smartphone typing
                   speeds of individuals in the age group of our
                   participant (115 characters per minute)8. Finally,
                   theoretical considerations explain why temporally
                   complex movements, such as handwriting, may be
                   fundamentally easier to decode than point-to-point
                   movements. Our results open a new approach for BCIs
                   and demonstrate the feasibility of accurately
                   decoding rapid, dexterous movements years after
                   paralysis.},

                   less explored yet less taxing visual BCI paradigm
                   relies on a briefly moving stimulus, the onset of
                   which elicits a lateralized potential over the

Moreover, different values for the decimation of the training dataset were tested. The results were evaluated both in terms of accuracy and written symbol rate with the data of 19 healthy subjects. No significant differences among the considered classifiers were found. The optimal decimation factor spanned a range from 3 to 24 (12 to 94 ms long bins). Nevertheless, performance on individually optimized classification parameters is not significantly different from a classification with general parameters (i.e. using an LDA classifier, about 48 ms long bins).},

Recent studies have shown that the recognition accuracy of the P300 speller decreases significantly when eye movement is impaired. This report introduces the GeoSpell interface (Geometric Speller), which implements a stimulation framework for a P300-based BCI that has been optimised for operation in covert visual attention. We compared the Geospell with the P300 speller interface under overt attention conditions with regard to effectiveness, efficiency and user satisfaction. Ten healthy subjects participated in the study. The performance of the GeoSpell interface in covert attention was comparable with that of the P300 speller in overt attention. As expected, the effectiveness of the spelling decreased with the new interface in covert attention. The NASA task load index (TLX) for workload assessment did not differ significantly between the two modalities. Practitioner Summary: This study introduces and evaluates a gaze-independent, P300-based brain–computer interface, the efficacy and user satisfaction of which were comparable with those off the classical P300 speller. Despite a decrease in effectiveness due to the use of covert attention, the performance of the GeoSpell far exceeded the threshold of accuracy with regard to effective spelling.},

  abstract  = {Many people affected by debilitating neuromuscular disorders such as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, brainstem stroke or spinal cord injury are impaired in their ability to, or are even unable to, communicate. A brain–computer interface (BCI) uses brain signals, rather than muscles, to re-establish communication with the outside world. One particular BCI approach is the so-called ‘P300 matrix speller’ that was first described by Farwell and Donchin (1988 Electroencephalogr. Clin. Neurophysiol. 70 510–23). It has been widely assumed that this method does not depend on the ability to focus on the desired character, because it was thought that it relies primarily on the P300-evoked potential and minimally, if at all, on other EEG features such as the visual-evoked potential (VEP). This issue is highly relevant for the clinical application of this BCI method, because eye movements may be impaired or lost in the relevant user population. This study investigated the extent to which the performance in a ‘P300’ speller BCI depends on eye gaze. We evaluated the performance of 17 healthy subjects using a ‘P300’ matrix speller under two conditions. Under one condition (‘letter’), the subjects focused their eye gaze on the intended letter, while under the second condition (‘center’), the subjects focused their eye gaze on a fixation cross that was located in the center of the matrix. The results show that the performance of the ‘P300’ matrix speller in normal subjects depends in considerable measure on gaze direction. They thereby disprove a widespread assumption in BCI research, and suggest that this BCI might function more effectively for people who retain some eye-movement control. The applicability of these findings to people with severe neuromuscular disabilities (particularly in eye-movements) remains to be determined.},

  abstract  = {Brain Computer Interfaces (BCIs) offer restoration of communication to those with the most severe movement impairments, but performance is not yet ideal. Previous work has demonstrated that latency jitter, the variation in timing of the brain responses, plays a critical role in determining BCI performance. In this study, we used Classifier-Based Latency Estimation (CBLE) and a wavelet transform to provide information about latency jitter to a second-level classifier. Three second-level classifiers were tested: least squares (LS), step-wise linear discriminant analysis (SWLDA), and support vector machine (SVM). Of these three, LS and SWLDA performed better than the original online classifier. The resulting combination demonstrated improved detection of brain responses for many participants, resulting in better BCI performance. Interestingly, the performance gain was greatest for those individuals for whom the BCI did not work well online, indicating that this method may be most suitable for improving performance of otherwise marginal participants.},

  abstract  = {The present review systematically examines the literature reporting gaze independent interaction modalities in non-invasive brain–computer interfaces (BCIs) for communication. BCIs measure signals related to specific brain activity and translate them into device control signals. This technology can be used to provide users with severe motor disability (e.g. late stage amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS); acquired brain injury) with an assistive device that does not rely on muscular contraction. Most of the studies on BCIs explored mental tasks and paradigms using visual modality. Considering that in ALS patients the oculomotor control can deteriorate and also other potential users could have impaired visual function, tactile and auditory modalities have been investigated over the past years to seek alternative BCI systems which are independent from vision. In addition, various attentional mechanisms, such as covert attention and feature-directed attention, have been investigated to develop gaze independent visual-based BCI paradigms. Three areas of research were considered in the present review: (i) auditory BCIs, (ii) tactile BCIs and (iii) independent visual BCIs. Out of a total of 130 search results, 34 articles were selected on the basis of pre-defined exclusion criteria. Thirteen articles dealt with independent visual BCIs, 15 reported on auditory BCIs and the last six on tactile BCIs, respectively. From the review of the available literature, it can be concluded that a crucial point is represented by the trade-off between BCI systems/paradigms with high accuracy and speed, but highly demanding in terms of attention and memory load, and systems requiring lower cognitive effort but with a limited amount of communicable information. These issues should be considered as priorities to be explored in future studies to meet users’ requirements in a real-life scenario.},

  abstract  = {Objective. Several ERP-based brain–computer interfaces (BCIs) that can be controlled even without eye movements (covert attention) have been recently proposed. However, when compared to similar systems based on overt attention, they displayed significantly lower accuracy. In the current interpretation, this is ascribed to the absence of the contribution of short-latency visual evoked potentials (VEPs) in the tasks performed in the covert attention modality. This study aims to investigate if this decrement (i) is fully explained by the lack of VEP contribution to the classification accuracy; (ii) correlates with lower temporal stability of the single-trial P300 potentials elicited in the covert attention modality. Approach. We evaluated the latency jitter of P300 evoked potentials in three BCI interfaces exploiting either overt or covert attention modalities in 20 healthy subjects. The effect of attention modality on the P300 jitter, and the relative contribution of VEPs and P300 jitter to the classification accuracy have been analyzed. Main results. The P300 jitter is higher when the BCI is controlled in covert attention. Classification accuracy negatively correlates with jitter. Even disregarding short-latency VEPs, overt-attention BCI yields better accuracy than covert. When the latency jitter is compensated offline, the difference between accuracies is not significant. Significance. The lower temporal stability of the P300 evoked potential generated during the tasks performed in covert attention modality should be regarded as the main contributing explanation of lower accuracy of covert-attention ERP-based BCIs.},

  abstract = {Covariance matrices of noisy multichannel electroencephalogram time series data are hard to estimate due to high dimensionality. In brain-computer interfaces (BCI) based on event-related potentials and a linear discriminant analysis (LDA) for classification, the state of the art to address this problem is by shrinkage regularization. We propose a novel idea to tackle this problem by enforcing a block-Toeplitz structure for the covariance matrix of the LDA, which implements an assumption of signal stationarity in short time windows for each channel. On data of 213 subjects collected under 13 event-related potential BCI protocols, the resulting 'ToeplitzLDA' significantly increases the binary classification performance compared to shrinkage regularized LDA (up to 6 AUC points) and Riemannian classification approaches (up to 2 AUC points). This translates to greatly improved application level performances, as exemplified on data recorded during an unsupervised visual speller application, where spelling errors could be reduced by 81\% on average for 25 subjects. Aside from lower memory and time complexity for LDA training, ToeplitzLDA proved to be almost invariant even to a twenty-fold time dimensionality enlargement, which reduces the need of expert knowledge regarding feature extraction.},
